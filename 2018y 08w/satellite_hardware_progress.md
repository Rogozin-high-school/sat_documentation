# Weekly Progress Report

## General

**Team Name**: _Satellite Hardware_  
**Date**: _26.02.2018_

## Achievements

1. After connecting the magnetometer and writing it's python module we wanted to write a gyro module too.  
We started working on it but one of the main problems we encountered was that the  
gyro returned the angular velocity of the module and not it's degrees so we need to work on it.
2. We lost one of the mpu9265 modules. It was connected to the raspberry pi 3 and it became very hot to touch  
and didn't respond anymore.

## Goals

1. We hope to finish the gyro module in the next week or 2.  
2. One of the reasons we wanted to write a gyro module is too create a demo experiment  
that would send the gyro data to a unity simulation and show it in 3D.
