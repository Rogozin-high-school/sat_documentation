# Weekly Progress Report

## General

**Team Name**: Satellite Hardware  
**Date**: _[ 04/03/2018 ]_

## Achievements
Remote Control system on the satellite.  
We can know wirelessly, fully control the satellite on board computer using FTP and SSH.  
After the raspberry pi boots it opens a wifi hotspot which we can log into and control the pi.  
While setting up the hotspot we had the most success while using [this](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui) software.

## Goals
We want to do some more tests on the gyro, magnetometer and make sure the hardware and software modules  
all function correctly due to some unexpected behavior of both modules.
