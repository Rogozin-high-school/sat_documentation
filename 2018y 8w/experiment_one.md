# Mini experiment one  

### The goal
The goal of the experiment is for us to be able to rotate the satellite unit in 3D space, and see a visual representation  
of it's rotation in a computer simulation.  

### Why ?
In order to start testing and integrating all of the different modules we want to setup up a small mini experiment.  
In this experiment we want to test our gyro module, communications module, simulation engine and this would give us some  
experiment in setting up and using the remote control system.  

### How ?
For us to achieve that we plan to use the gyro module and using the communications module, send gyro data to the unity simulation engine.  
The unity simulation engine can use that data and show it in 3D space.
