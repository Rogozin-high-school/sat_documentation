# Raspberry Pi Zero W Purchase Document

## Order

**Team**: Satellite Computer

**Date**: 08/01/2018

## Item

**Item Name**: Raspberry Pi Zero W

**Description**: The Raspberry Pi Zero W is a small, linux based computer.  
I want to buy it because we need a computer to sit inside of the satellite (during the experiments).  
We wanted a computer from the raspberry pi series because they have a small form factor, linux based and easy to use.  
The reason we went with the zero w in particular is becuase it the smallest of the series and comes with wifi (unlike the zero).

**Price**: 100 ils

### Talmir electronics
You can find the pi zero at talmir electronics but it doesn't have onboard wifi, it's also a bit pricier but it's closer so it  
would arrive faster.

### Piitel
Piitel is an online shop that sells the raspberry pi zero w, it does have onboard wifi and cheaper,  
but would probably take more time to arrive.

## Technical details
The pi zero comes with Wifi and around 40 GPIO pins. Due to the fact that the zero w is not a very powerful computer,  
usually a linux distro is installed on it.
