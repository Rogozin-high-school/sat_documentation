# Weekly Progress Report

This document is used to describe a weekly progress for a team. File it every week, before the meeting.

## General

**Team Name**: _Laboratory/Experiment System Team_
<br/>
**Date**: _26/03/2018_

## Achievements

1. Resent a formal quote request for the air bearing. Waiting for response, again.
2. Create a structured software model for the mathematical & physical modules
3. Write the documentation and interface (no implementations) of the hardware drivers
4. Write the interface of the field calculation layers
5. Research the protocol of the ZUP60-3.5 power supply (RS232 serial line).
6. Wire up a converter from USB connection to the RS232 port of the power supply.
7. File a complete purchase request for the copper wires (to be ordered on 27/03/2018)
8. We got readable and logical results from the magnetometer (!)

## Goals

1. Verify that the quote request is received and that a response is sent.
2. Call the company supplying the air bearings for a more explicit quote request.
3. Review the math module, add documentation if not present, structure, etc.
4. Test the USB2RS232 connector we have wired against the supply and hope it gives readable results.
5. Fill in the math formulas and equations in the math module.
6. Validate the quality of the equations in the field calculation layers.
7. Wire up the magnetometer as a service (SeaaS - Sensor As A Service)
